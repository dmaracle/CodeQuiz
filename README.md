# CodeQuiz

Made a quiz with several javascript questions designed to educate a beginner programmer

The correct answer will light up green every time so that the student may know immediately what the correct response was.

There is also a timer on the page in order to encourage the student to think quickly and add an element of pressure.

At the end of the quiz there will be a high score posted that the student may share with other people whom have tried taking the quiz before.

The elements and style of the page are designed to be easily readable by the user so that they may commit these questions/answers to memory easier.

At the end of the program there is a restart button that refreshes the page so that the student may test his memory/knowledge skills again if he/she feels the need to do so.
